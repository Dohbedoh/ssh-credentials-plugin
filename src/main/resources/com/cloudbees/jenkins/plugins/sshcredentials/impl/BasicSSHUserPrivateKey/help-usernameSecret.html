    By default, usernames are not masked in the build log.
    You may choose to mask a credential's username if you consider it to be sensitive information.
    However, this can interfere with diagnostics.
    For example, if the username is a common word it will cause unrelated occurrences of that word to also be masked.
    <br>
    Regardless of this setting, the username will be displayed in the selection dropdown to anyone permitted to reconfigure the credentials.
