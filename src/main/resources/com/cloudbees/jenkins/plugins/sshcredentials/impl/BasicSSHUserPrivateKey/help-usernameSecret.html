    Historically, not only passphrases but usernames were masked in the build log.
    Since these can interfere with diagnostics,
    and cause unrelated occurrences of a common word to be masked,
    you may choose to leave usernames unmasked if they are not sensitive.
    Note that regardless of this setting, the username will be displayed to anyone permitted to reconfigure the credentials.
